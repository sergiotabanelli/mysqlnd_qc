1.1.0 - alpha

  Release date: 04/2012
  Motto/theme : Schema pattern based caching and mysqlnd_ms support

  * Introduced mysqlnd_qc_set_cache_condition() for built-in schema pattern based caching
  * Changed is_select() signature from `bool is_select()` to `mixed is_select()`. Mixed can be
    either boolean or array(long ttl, string server_id). This is needed by PECL/mysqlnd_ms
  * Introduce MYSQLND_QC_SERVER_ID_SWITCH which allows grouping of cache entries from different
    physical connections. This is needed by PECL/mysqlnd_ms.
  * Include charset number for cache entry hashing. This should prevent serving result
    sets which have the wrong charset. API change: get_hash_key expects new "charsetnr" (int)
    parameter after "port"
  * Introduced mysqlnd_qc.ignore_sql_comments to control whether SQL comments are ignored for hashing
  * Excluded SQL comments from SQL string for cache entry hashing. This fixes the issue
    of holding the same result set multiple times in the cache
  * Standard/default handler now reports "valid_until" through mysqlnd_qc_get_cache_info()
  * Fix bug #59959 (config.m4, wrong library - 64bit memcached handler builds) (Credits: Remi Collet)
  * Restructure code for mysqlnd_ms compatibility
  * Fixed APC storage handler build for APC 3.1.9+
  * Fixed 5.4 build
